# What is BRACU DICHARI ? 
 
ERL (European Robotics League) is a tournament that focuses on real-world challenges like rescue operations and many more. It has been organized since 2017. Under the themes of intelligent urban environments, teams will compete in three exciting robotics categories. Europe's most famous robotics institutes consortium will host annual local tournaments for competitors. This year's ERL2022 will be held in Poznan, Poland.
As BRAC University has previously accomplished much in the field of robotics through BracU Onnesha, MongolTori, Duburi, and other contests, it is now time to demonstrate our abilities on reality-based challenges for the first time through “BRACU Dichari.” 
There are different sub-teams. They are Management, Electronics, Control & Software, Mechanical, Network , 3D Design, AI & autonomous.
Robotic competitions satisfy educational goals and can be a good platform for future engineers and scientists to enhance their talents.
